# File Encryption and Decryption Program
## Please note that this project is incomplete and does not work as intended!

This is a project for practice and learning purposes. It is a Java program that can encrypt and decrypt files using various encryption algorithms such as AES, DES, and RSA. The program also has a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to select the file they want to encrypt or decrypt and display the progress of the encryption/decryption process.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you will need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download the latest version of the JDK from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).

## Usage

To use this program, run the `FileEncryptionGUI.java` class in your Java IDE. This will launch the GUI and allow you to select the file you want to encrypt or decrypt. Please note that this project is incomplete and does not work as intended.

## Libraries

- **Java Standard Library**: The Java Standard Library is a collection of classes and interfaces that provide essential functionality for Java programs. In this project, we use several classes from the Java Standard Library for file I/O, exception handling, and other utility functions.

- **javax.swing package**: The `javax.swing` package provides classes for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java. In this project, we use `JFrame`, `JButton`, `JFileChooser`, and other classes from the `javax.swing` package to create a user-friendly GUI for selecting files to encrypt or decrypt, displaying the encryption progress, and handling user input.

- **javax.crypto package**: The `javax.crypto` package provides classes and interfaces for implementing cryptographic algorithms in Java. In this project, we use the `Cipher` class for encrypting and decrypting data using different encryption algorithms, such as AES, DES, and RSA. We also use the `KeyGenerator` class to generate random encryption keys for use with the encryption algorithms.
